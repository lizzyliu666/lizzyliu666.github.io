I am a Ph.D candidate at the **School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin**, advised by Dr. Yan Zhang. I am also a research associate at the Computational Affective and Social Cognition Lab at UT Austin, led by Prof. Desmond C. Ong (Psychology) and Prof. Jessy Li (CS). Before my doctoral study, I graduated from Peking University in 2021 with two B.S. degrees in Information Management and Economics, advised by Dr. Chang Liu. 

Drawing on theories from science and technology studies, psychology, and media studies, I examine how digital technologies intersect with social, cultural, and identity-related factors to shape health behaviors both online and offline. Through co-design with vulnerable communities, I develop responsible AI systems that enable authentic emotional expression and foster meaningful peer support networks.

#My research centers on three streams: (1) unpacking health communication on video-based social media using AI, (2) examining mental health care-seeking behaviors within sociotechnical systems, and (3) designing human-centered AI to support emotional well-being among marginalized populations.

My work has been published across top computing (ACM CSCW, ACM CHI, IEEE HRI), information science (JASIS&T, ASIS&T, L&ISR, ACM CHIIR), and health venues (JMIR, IEEE ICHI). My work has been recognized with four research awards, including two Best Paper Awards from ASIS&T SIG Health and SIG USE, as well as two Honorable Mention Awards from IEEE ICHI and iConference. My dissertation work was supported by prestigious fellowships and scholarships from the UT Austin Graduate School and the Berkeley Center for New Media.

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).
