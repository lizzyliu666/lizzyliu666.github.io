I am a Ph.D candidate at the <em><strong>School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin</strong></em>, advised by Dr. Yan Zhang. In pursuit of <em><strong>human flourishing</strong></em>, my goal is to build <strong>human-centered AI</strong> that enables <em>authentic emotional support</em> and strengthens <em>human connections</em>. I study how care-seeking unfolds across digital media and everyday life, with particular attention to <strong>disparities and risks</strong> affecting vulnerable populations. My research explores:

- **Revealing disparities of sensitive disclosure on video-based social media**, through LLM-assisted computational analysis of videos informed by self-presentation theory and semiotics.
- **Identifying <em>care encounters</em> as moments of change in real-world mental health help-seeking**, through in-depth interviews with marginalized young adults.
- **Informing human-centered AI for mental well-being and emotional support**, by developing ethical design guidelines for emotion AI systems that preserve human connections and strengthen peer support.


My work has been published across top computing (ACM CSCW, ACM CHI, IEEE HRI), information science (JASIS&T, ASIS&T, L&ISR, ACM CHIIR), and health venues (JMIR, IEEE ICHI). I have received **4 research awards**, including two **Best Paper Awards** from *ASIS&T* and two **Honorable Mentions** from the *iConference* and *IEEE International Conference on Health Informatics*. I have also received **dissertation funding** from the UT Austin Graduate School (\$52,000) and the Berkeley Center for New Media (\$2,500).

I am also a research associate at the Computational Affective and Social Cognition Lab at UT Austin, led by Prof. Desmond C. Ong (Psychology) and Prof. Jessy Li (CS). Before my doctoral study, I graduated from Peking University in 2021 with two B.S. degrees in Information Management and Economics.
