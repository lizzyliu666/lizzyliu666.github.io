I am a Ph.D candidate at the **School of Information at the University of Texas at Austin**, advised by Dr. Yan Zhang. I also work closely with Dr. Elliott Hauser. I graduated from Peking University in 2021 with two B.S. degrees in Information Management and Economics, advised by Dr. Chang Liu.

My research interests lie in the intersection of HCI, HRI, technology use, and mental well-being. I use both qualitative and quantitative approaches, participatory design, and ethnography to:

    explore the relationships between technology use (social media, videos, VR, and robotics) and human emotions

    and improve the mental well-being of historically underserved and marginalized communities such as first-generation college students in China

I am seeking undergraduates, master students, and peers to collaborate. Please don't hesitate to shoot me an email to brainstorm and develop ideas if you share similar interests with me!

This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).


Example: editing a markdown file for a talk
