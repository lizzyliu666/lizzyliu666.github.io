I study Social Computing>, Computer-Mediated Communication, and Human-Computer Interaction in health contexts. My work is motivated by <b><i>human flourishing</i></b> and <b><i>social justice</i></b>. I strive to advance <b>human-centered AI</b> that nurtures individual identities and strengthens human connections. 
      <br>
    I study how health care-seeking unfolds across digital media and everyday life, with particular attention to the <i>societal</i> and <i>ethical</i> dimensions of <b>multimodal and AI-mediated communication</b>, including emerging <i>disparities</i> and <i>risks</i> associated with video-based social media and AI companions. I further inform and design <b>care-oriented AI systems</b> that facilitate emotional expression and peer support. My previous work made three major contributions to <b>Health Behavior</b>, <b>Information Science</b>, <b>Human-Computer Interaction</b>, and <b>Computational Social Science</b>:

- **Revealing disparities of sensitive disclosure on video-based social media**, through LLM-assisted computational analysis of videos informed by self-presentation theory and semiotics.
- **Identifying <em>care encounters</em> as moments of change in real-world mental health help-seeking**, through in-depth interviews with marginalized young adults.
- **Informing human-centered AI for mental well-being and emotional support**, by developing ethical design guidelines for emotion AI systems that preserve human connections and strengthen peer support.

My work has been published across top computing (ACM CSCW, ACM CHI, IEEE HRI), information science (JASIS&T, ASIS&T, L&ISR, ACM CHIIR), and health venues (JMIR, IEEE ICHI). I have received **4 research awards**, including two **Best Paper Awards** from *ASIS&T* and two **Honorable Mentions** from the *iConference* and *IEEE International Conference on Health Informatics*. I have also received **dissertation funding** from the UT Austin Graduate School (\$52,000) and the Berkeley Center for New Media (\$2,500). 

Some of my ongoing and future projects will explore the **critical literacy of human–AI intimacy**, unpack disparities in **algorithm-mediated multimodal communication** on short video platforms through large language models, and advance responsible AI to support the **mental well-being of vulnerable communities**.

I am lucky to be advised by Dr. Yan Zhang, who always supports my research and personal growth. I am also a research associate at the Computational Affective and Social Cognition Lab at UT Austin, led by Prof. Desmond C. Ong (Psychology) and Prof. Jessy Li (CS). Before my doctoral study, I graduated from Peking University in 2021 with two B.S. degrees in Information Management and Economics.
